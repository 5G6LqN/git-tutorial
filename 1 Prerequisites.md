# 1 Prerequisites

## Get Git for your computer
This of course is mandatory. The others are optional but I would recommend them to improve your workflow.

https://git-scm.com/download/mac

## Mac: Get iTerm2
In case you want to know why, check out this: https://iterm2.com/features.html

https://iterm2.com/

## Mac: Switch to ZSH and Oh my ZSH
Apple is switching the standard shell from bash to zsh, so you might already have that set up. In case not:

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208050

Then get https://ohmyz.sh/ and put *plugins=(git git-prompt)* in your *~/.zshrc* file.

For details see https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins.

## Get a Git GUI locally
It gives you a graphical overview of what you are doing.

I like https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/, but there are many many others.

## Get a GitHub login
https://github.com/

If you prefer private repositories check out https://bitbucket.org/. Remember this is not a one way street, you can easily transfer repositories from one platform to the other.

Remember: GitHub is not Git. You don't need it to work with Git, but it is a very nice addition especially when you want to share stuff.

## Bedtime Reading
There is a free eBook telling you more than I know about Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
