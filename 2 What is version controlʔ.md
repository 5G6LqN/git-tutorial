# 2 What is version control?

In short, version control is used keep track of you changes in a file. This can be pretty much everything, R code, Word documents, images, ...

Have you been doing stuff like renaming files to something like

    file_1.txt
    file_2.txt

to keep track of older versions? Then you should give Git a try.

# What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system. This means you don't need access to a server somewhere. You always have the full snapshot of the repository on you computer. Imagine being on a plane, you have no access to the internet. But you can still work on your stuff without problems and sync later. Also, when a server dies, you can easily restore everything from your local copy. 

It also allows easy collaboration with others working on the same files. I'll introduce an easy workflow later.

One important thing: Git does only add data. So even when you delete a file and it not existing in your snapshot anymore it is not lost. There is always a way getting it back. So no reason to rename files to *myfile.txt.bak* or commenting out regions of code.

Check out the Git book for deatils.
